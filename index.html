    <p class="P_heading">Hi, my name is Abhishek Shrivastava and I am a self employed person. I run my own coaching institute <em>Abhishek Tutorials</em> where I teach Mathematics and Physics to students preparing for IIT-JEE/NEET and CBSE/State Board Exams.<br><br> I have recently started to develop an interest towards web applications and development, though learning about it initially started as a side project. I will be implementing those learnings here by developing my own personal website. So this place is going to be my roost for a while now.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p class="P_hobbies">I like learning new things and hence over the years I have developed a range of hobbies that I like to play with. Besides, I am also a full time stock market investor and trader, so a considerable time of mine is devoted to learning about new investment oppurtunities. Actually the curiosity about web development originated from my perosnal need to automate some stuffs related to my investment framework. Some other things I like to do and rating my skills on them in a range of 1-5:</p>

            <td>Cooking</td>
            <td class="star">&#9733;</td>
            <td>Strategy games</td>
            <td class="star">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</td>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table></div>

      <p class="P_hobbies">I also like to do workout exercises either at gym or at home, though that is something I have lost touch with and have to redevelop. And I absolutely cannot live without restaurants &#128540;.</p>

      <h3>Note</h3>
      <p class="P_note">This is an ongoing work in development webpage and not the final product. There are many items that I may change the look and feel of in future. Also, some of the elements are redundant like this block that you are reading &#128521;&#128515;. The intention as of now however is to implement the things I am learning more than worrying about content, their asthetics and optimisation of performance.</p>
